    <div class="about-grid">


      <p>
        I am a Mechanical Engineer from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I recently completed my Master of Science (MS)
        degree from the College of Engineering in May 2019. I am currently working as an Additive Manufacturing & Design Engineer 
        at ADDFab Lab in Life Sciences Laboratories.</p>
        <p>I have a prior industry experience of over two years and research experience of over a year at top-notch labs in UMass. 
        During my engineering career, I have worked on a variety of projects and have played a part in researching and developing
        new technologies, product quality improvements, cost reductions efforts for products, efficiency and productivity enhancement,
        and developing strong business relations with the customers, vendors and suppliers. 
        </p>
        <p>I have honed my skills in Product and Process Design & Development, CAD modeling, Advanced Manufacturing and Rapid Prototyping
        techniques like Additive Manufacturing, which is known as 3D Printing, Lean Six Sigma, Advanced Data Analysis, and a few skills
        of industrial automation like PLC & HMI/SCADA Systems. I believe that all the industrial experiences coupled with my academics
        have helped me to augment my project management, problem-solving, communication skills, and collaborative skills in the
        fast-paced environment. </p>


      <p><b>Looking for full time opportuinities starting in September 2019.</b></p>
