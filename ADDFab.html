          <p><b><i> Overview:</i></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            I currently work as an Additive Manufacturing & Design Engineer at ADDFab. It was converted to a part-time position when I got 
            an offer for a full-time job in Massachusetts. I started working as a volunteer
            at this facility. I didn't know that UMass has such a huge, high-tech 3D printing research lab until Fall 2018. I came to know about 3D printing when
            I took a course on Additive Manufacturing during my MS degree. As a part of that course, I got the opportunity to visit ADDFab
            lab. I was simply awestruck by the top-notch printers at this facility. After the tour, I requested the director of the lab to allow me
            to work as a volunteer so that I can gain hands-on experiences along with the theoritical stuff. That's how my journey started!
            
            Since then, I have worked on multiple projects and have helped researchers on campus and in local industries to rapid prototype
            parts in less turnaround time. My motivation to work at ADDFab is to explore the capabilities of Additive Manufacturing and
            evaluate 3D Printing as a potentially vibale solution for rapid prototyping parts. I basically help people to design parts
            from napkin sketch, propose best material based on their requirements and 3D print parts using metal and polymer printers. 
            The overall experience has been good so far. It really feels great when you 3D print parts and
            empower the reseachers to do great things so that they can contribute to the society for better living.
            
            I have a huge list of projects which I have worked on during my tenure. I won't be able to share pictures of the projects as
            most of them are patented designs. But I can give you some information just to give you a taste of it.

           - Obaggo Plastic Bag Recycling: Obaggo is a kitchen appliance that enables you to recycle your plastic bags and packaging film,
            such as bread bags, cereal box liners, paper product overwrap, etc., in the comfort and convenience of your curbside recycling 
            bin. " Our solution for recycling plastic film is to enable consumers and businesses to densify their plastic into rigid pucks 
            that are economical to collect curbside, and easy to sort at Material Recovery Facilities.  We want to prove that this 
            material is valuable by turning the collected material into new recycled products, creating a circular economy for thin 
            film plastic packaging" - David New, Obaggo Recycling, LLC (https://www.obaggo.com/)
