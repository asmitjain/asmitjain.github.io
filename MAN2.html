          <p><b><i> Overview:</i></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            I started my career at MAN Trucks India as a Maintenance Engineer Intern in June 2014. It was a manufacturing facility for the 
            best in class german trucks for the Asia Pacific region. This was my first industrial experience of my career. Seeing an 
            automotive plant for the first time in my life was an overwhelming and exciting moment. I couldn't believe my eyes on how huge
            that facility was. 
<br>
          <br>

           As this was my first encounter within an industrial setting, my motivation to work at MAN Trucks was to gain insight into how a company works, what all departments
           a company has, what kinds of machines a company uses and to get a deeper understanding of automotive engineering. Before describing
           anything about my projects, I'd like to tell you more about the company.
          <br>
          <br>

            tractors for long haul transport. By acquiring full ownership, MAN Truck & Bus India has now taken sole responsibility 
            for the production and sale of the trucks both within and outside India. Truck in the Box. As the name suggests, Truck
            in the Box TIB is the MAN concept for CKD (Completely knocked down) or SKD (Semi knocked down) vehicles – i.e. the 
            disassembly of a vehicle in order to ship it to another site for final assembly.
