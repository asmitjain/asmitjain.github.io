      <p><b><i> Fault detection for metal etch process data using Machine Learning in MATLAB:</i></b>
        <br>
        • Aimed to develop a preventive approach using Machine Learning for manufacturing industries.
        <br>
        • Performed Multiway Principal Component Analysis on data for control monitoring using MATLAB.
        <br>
• Evaluated the model by performing k-fold cross-validation and using statistical methods to measure accuracy.
        <br>
        <br>
<p><b><i> Design of a Multivariable system using QFT control design toolbox in MATLAB:</i></b>
        <br>
        This was based on the computer-based design methodologies for the synthesis of multivariable feedback control system. 
        It was the first attempt to learn a new designing toolbox in MATLAB known as Quantitative Feedback Theory. QFT toolbox 
        is used to design a multivariable control system, which has more than one input and output. Any disturbances in the system 
        can greatly affect the results. We were presented with an uncertain plant family with some output disturbances. I designed 
        a controller and a prefilter such that the closed loop system achieves the stability. This was done by loop shaping the 
        components by plotting templates & margin bounds using toolbox for meeting the margin and tracking specifications. I also 
        made an attempt to tune the slightly over designed system w/o affecting the performance of the MIMO systems.

        <p><b><i> Design & Analysis of a Passive Suspension system using MATLAB and SIMULINK:</i></b>
        <br>
        Designing of an automotive suspension is an interesting and challenging task. The system must be designed in a way 
        to ensure minimum transmission of road shocks and always maintain a certain level of passenger comfort. Road excitations
        in the form of bumps or holes produce oscillatory motion in the spring-damper systems, which are the type of suspension
        taken into consideration in this project. This oscillatory motion can lead to passenger discomfort if not under a certain
        limit.
<br>
<br>
This project focuses on developing mathematical models for the analysis of the system response under different loading conditions. 
The first model considered is the classic Quarter car model widely used for ride and handling analysis. Further Half car models for 
simulating pitching and rolling motion of the vehicle are developed. All mathematical models are developed using state space
representation and thus result in differential equations governing the motion of the spring and damper systems. These differential 
equations were solved using MATLAB and Simulink and the results were analysed under the context of passenger comfort.

        <p><b><i> Designing of different sub-systems of an All-Terrain Vehicle:</i></b>
        <br>
        This project presents a detailed research into the designing of an All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV). ATVs are basically
        compact and open motor vehicles fitted with large treaded-tires, used primarily for off-road expeditions or for adventure 
        rides on rough terrain. A literature review has been done of the research work that has been done nationally and 
        internationally in the sphere of ATV design and of the underlying subsystems.
<br>
<br>
Based on our experience of successfully designing and manufacturing an All Terrain Vehicle for BAJA SAE student design 
competitions, we presented the intended design targets for an ATV's systems along with the structural or dynamic analysis 
to be performed on them.
