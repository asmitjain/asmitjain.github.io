          <p><b><i> Overview:</i></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            I got the opportunity to work as a Sales & Application Engineer at MAHLE Engine Components India. This was my first
            full-time role after my bachelor's degree. I was based out of Pithampur plant in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was a 
            techno-commercial job where I worked on new & running projects with 25 automotive companies worldwide and applied my engineering
            skills to understand how things work for application engineering part.
<br>
          <br>

           As this was my first encounter within an industrial setting, my motivation to work at MAN Trucks was to gain insight into how a company works, what all departments
           a company has, what kinds of machines a company uses and to get a deeper understanding of automotive engineering. Before describing
           anything about my projects, I'd like to tell you more about the company.
          <br>
          <br>
            MAN (Maschinenfabrik Augsburg- Nürnberg) SE, formerly MAN AG, is a German mechanical engineering company and parent
