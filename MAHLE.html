          <p><b><i> Overview:</i></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            I got the opportunity to work as a Sales & Application Engineer at MAHLE Engine Components India in April 2016. This was my first
            full-time role after my bachelor's degree. I was based out of Pithampur plant in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was a 
            techno-commercial job where I worked on new & running projects with 25 automotive companies worldwide and applied my engineering
            skills to understand how things work for application engineering part.
          <br>
          <br>
            MAHLE group ranks among the top three system suppliers worldwide with 140 production locations on 5 continents. It has 5 
            different business units and 7 different profit centers. Some of the business units include: 
            <br> - Engine Systems and Components
            <br> - Filteration and Engine Peripherals
            <br> - Thermal Management
            <br> - Industry
            <br> - Aftermarket
            <br>
            <br>
            MECI Pithampur is the largest producer of engine components and valve tappets in India with over 50% of market share. They 
            supply camshafts and valve tappets to all the major OEMs. MAHLE has two manufacturing facilities in Pithampur. 
            I was fortunate to work and manage both the manufacturing sites. One is the foundry
            which is equipped with the advanced Green Sand & Shell Sand. It is used to produce high volume cast engine components. 
            And the other one is for machining, where all the VMCs and HMCs are used for machining the cast components. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I got exposure to all types of processes related to manufacturing, quality, production planning, sales, budgeting, etc which
            was very helpful to understand the cross functional team environment at MAHLE. As an engineer, I was involved in numerous projects
            as a cross functional team member with different departments to contribute to the company to develop and deliver high
            quality products.
