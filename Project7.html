        SAE ( Society of Automotive Engineers ) International is a worldwide body of Automotive  and  Aerospace engineering 
        professional with  over  121,000 members. The society is  a standard  development organization for the engineering of 
        powered vehicles of all kinds, including cars,  trucks,  boats, aircrafts etc. 
        <br>
<br>
        SAE India, established in 2002 as an official affiliate of SAE International, is a non-profit engineering and scientific 
        society dedication to the advancement of mobility industry in India. Baja SAE India 2014 is jointly organized by SAE India,
        ARAI  (Automotive research association of India)  and  NATRIP  (National Automotive Testing and R&D Infrastructure Project).

      <p><b><i> BAJA OVERVIEW:</i></b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Baja (pronounced as “BAHA”) SAE India 2014 is a single seat IC engine powered, off road vehicle design and fabrication 
        contest organized by SAE India, an affiliate to SAE International. Started in 2007 the competition has witnessed rapid 
        growth. Internationally the competition has been held for a number of years in USA, Brazil, South Africa and South Korea 
        and India.
<br>
<br>
        The objective of competition is to provide SAE student members with a challenging product design, engineering, planning,
        manufacturing and marketing – the task to be fulfilled when introducing a new product to the consumer industrial market.
<br>
<br>
Teams compete against each other to have their design accepted for manufacture by a fictitious firm. Students must work as a 
team not only to design, build, test and race their vehicle within the limits of the rules, but also to generate financial support
for their project meanwhile managing their educational priorities. Each team’s goal is to design and build a prototype of a rugged
single seat off road recreational four wheel  vehicle  intended for sale to a non-professional, weekend off road enthusiast. 
The competition goals include that the vehicle must be safe, easily transported, easily maintained and fun to drive. It should be 
able to negotiate rough terrains in all weather conditions without damage.
