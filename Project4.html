      <h2> Process Visualization with HMI/ SCADA Systems</h2>

      <p><b><i> MOTIVATIOIN:</i></b>
        <br>
        <br>
        After programming some complex PLC programs in Siemens & Allen-Bradley Rockwell Automation, I was determined to learn some HMI & SCADA
        programming so that I can not only control the machines and equipment, but interact with them using a display. I created some
        graphical interfaces which the operators can use to monitor automated process, establish operating parameters, and even 
        acquire and warehouse data from a running system.
        <br>
        <br>
   <p><b><i> SOFTWARE:</i></b>
          <br>
          <br>
        I got an opportunity to learn 5 different HMI software:
        <br>
        <b>1. Wonderware (Schneider Electric / Indusoft)</b> which is perhaps the top solution in the world of process visualization.
        <br>
        <b>2. C-More</b> 
        <br>
        <b>3. EasyBuilder 5000</b>
        <br>
        <b>4. AdvancedHMI</b> 
        <br>
        <b>5. FactoryTalk View Studio</b> 
        <br>
        <br>
   <p><b><i> PROJECT:</i></b>
         <br>
        <img src="./images/asmitjainP4_2.PNG" alt="My HMI" class="center">
         <br>
         <b> Equipment:</b> Here is the P&ID diagram which walk us through the complete intrumentation and inputs/ outputs. If we see from the left,
         we have a infinite water supply. Then, we have a Solenoid Valve (SV) which will be controlled by PLC. In total, we have 6 SVs.
         We will energize and deenergize the valves to open and close it. 
         <br>
         Then we have a Flow Switch (FS) which will be activated when the water flows through it. Pump (P) will be ON when energized and
         OFF when deenergized. The next thing in this system is Pressure Transmitter (PT). It basically reads the pressure value and gives
         analog value to PLC. The last thing we have is Level Transmitter (LT) which reads the value of the tank level. You might notice
         that there is one last thing which I have not mentioned. It it is the Ball Valve (BV) which is manually controlled valve. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b> Working:</b> Pump (P-1) will take the water from the reservoir through valve (SV-1). It will pass through a flow switch
         (FS-1) which will protect our pump when there is no flow. This flow switch can be monitored by PLC. The water flows through other
         valve and passes through two pressure transmitter via filter. If there is some resistance in the flow due to filter blockage, it
         will go to the cleaning mode which will force water to flow backward through the filter. This backward flow will clean the filter
         and will push the dirt to the drainage system. 
         <br>
         <br>
         Now, back to the normal flow. If everything is good, the clean water will be collected in the tank so that people can use it.
         There is thrid mode which will help us to clean the filter. In this, we will not take water from our reservoir, instead, we 
         will take clean water from the tank through SV-2. The water will pass through SV-4 and SV-6. Remaining all the valves will be
         closed. 
         <br>
