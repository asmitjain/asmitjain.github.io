          <p><b><i> Overview:</i></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            I worked as a Technical Services Intern at Volvo-Eicher Commerical Vehicles India in July 2018. This was my fourth
            industrial experience and was done during my summer vacation time of my master's degree. I was based out of Pithampur plant 
            in Madhya Pradesh, India. VECV is a partnership that brings together Global leadership in technology, quality, safety and environmental care, along 
            with the deep knowledge and understanding of the Indian Commercial Vehicle (CV) market. VE Commercial Vehicles Limited. 
            (VECV) owes its inception to the compelling intent of driving modernization in commercial transportation, in India and 
            other developing markets.
            <br>
            <br>
            Operational since July 2008, VE Commercial Vehicles Ltd. (VECV) comprises of five business verticals â€“ Eicher Trucks and 
            Buses, Volvo Trucks India, Eicher Engineering Components and VE Powertrain. VECV includes the complete range of Eicher's 
            commercial vehicles, components and engineering design businesses as well as the sales and distribution of Volvo trucks.
            Each of its 'business units are already well established and backed by a sizable customer base.
            <br>
            <br>
            The state-of-the-art plant in Pithampur has access to top line manufacturing processes, which includes cab weld shop 
            with robotic welding, CED paint shop, integrated testing facilities, 100% hot test facility for engines and a lean and 
            scalable manufacturing set up. The machine shop has 17 Horizontal machining centers, special purpose machine for critical 
            operations like crank bore, cam bore, piston bore and joint face finish machining. The transmission assembly section has
            hydraulic press for pressing of bearings and a sound proof enclosure for checking abnormal noise in the transmission units 
            being produced. The plant also has robotic welding facilities for main body and under body welding. A pre-delivery
            automated inspection facility is also there to check the speed and brake related parameters, turning angle and wheel
            alignment issues before delivery of the final product to the dealer/customer. The plant has an annual production 
            capacity of 48,000 units.
            <br>
            <br>
            Here at VECV, I was responsible for enhancing the efficiency and productivity of the manufacturing lines, 
            automating some of the manual engine assembly operations, installation and testing of Automatic Guided Vehicle
            and troubleshooting using DFMEA/ PFMEA. It was an amazing opportunity where I learned a lot at high volume production lines.
            I got the opportunity to interact directly with vendors, internal team to solve their production problems and present 
            technical solutions and troubleshooting steps for actual implementation.
