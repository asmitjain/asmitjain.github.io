      <h2> Designing, Prototyping & Validating a Digital Motor Controlled 3D Scanner for Macroscopic Medical Application</h2>
        <br>

      <p>To circumvent the difficulties encountered during the methods of eye estimation, tape and caliper, there is a need to 
        develop a prototype which can be combined with latest technologies to get 3D images in a less turnaround time. There 
        are available devices in the market which are difficult in turning camera at high speed and are slow in image processing 
        based on the target detection. 

        This study will deal with a design methodology which will help us to devlop a scanner to generate 3D models for medical research.
        A device which can capture high resolution, reliable images and combine them together using the technique called Photogrammetry. 
        The primarily target area for this study would be for developing scanned models for medical applications e.g. Monoclonal cells
        or manufacturing industries for macroscopic products.</p>

        <p>Photogrammetry is referred to the science in which one makes measurements using photographs. This is the practice of 
        utilizing accelerated photography along with remote sensing for creating 3D models from two-dimensional photographs.
        This is a unique application that’s garnered a high level of interest from several relevant industries, businesses, and
        private individuals.

       Following are a few of the benefits you can attain by applying photogrammetry for industrial use:
<br>
          <br>
      •	A fully automatic process for image acquisition and report generation
    <br>
      •	Automation of repetitive tasks with the use of macros
      
      <br>
        •	Faster and more accurate decision making
<br>
        <br>
        Photogrammetry is one of the many fields of three-dimensional measurement associated with surveying. Photogrammetry 
        has been used for medical applications since midway through the nineteenth century and is now beginning to regain 
        its past popularity due to recent developments in real time instrumentation. Medical photogrammetry, now part of the 
        broader field known as biostereometrics, has had varying popularity over the past one hundred and fifty years due to 
        the many problems encountered during practical applications.</p>

        I started this project by making a few CAD models using SolidWorks. There are two pictures attached with an isometric view and a
        side view. The model contains an arm which hold a camera unit. The arm is mounted on a mechanical stage (PI U-651) which rotates the camera
        in 360 degree. This mechanical stage is connected to a breadboad which keeps the setup stable. To avoid floor vibrations and noise,
        we mounted all these components on a TMC Optical Table. 
        <br>
        A Basler ACE A2040 camera unit with Mitutoyo 20x infinite corrected objective lens was used which were mounted on a 3D printed arm.
        Several design iterations were made for the 3D printed part based on the external forces. I also did some FEA analysis using ANSYS.

        Later, some modifications were made in the camera mounting clamps for robust design.

      <br>
      After three iterations, we were able to get a good design for our 3D scanner prototype. Several parts were 3D printed to mount
        all the equipment together on an optical bench. Some trials were taken at different speeds using PI controller to see how intact
        the prototype is. The results were quite satisfactory. Slider mechanism works amazingly well to change the working distance
        of the optical unit. Some trials were taken to check the effects of the spring on an uneven surface. The caster ball supports 
        the heavy optical unit very well without bending the arm.
        <br>
        Work is still in progress. Please stay tuned for some sample images taken by this setup.
